         <h1>Introduction to Web Design and Development</h1><br>
	 
         <h2>Overview</h2>
	 
	     <p>This Term we will use client side technologies to structure and present web pages, and to make them interactive. We will be able to produce highly-readable, best-practice client-side code that is event- and object-driven, and runs on multiple browsers and platforms; and apply web design usability principles to our web production.</p><br>
	 
	     <p>In the first six weeks we will learn the basic building blocks of the web - HTML5 and CSS - and produce our own website using HTML5.In the final five weeks we will learn the fundamentals of writing readable front-end event-driven JavaScript, with a focus on the HTML5 video API.</p><br>
	 
	     <p>In the second term we will use server-side resources with our web pages, including databases and files located on a server using the back-end scripting language PHP, in conjunction with MySQL server-side databases.</p><br>
	 
	     <h2>What we have covered so far.</h2><br>

         <h2>Overview</h2>
	 
	     <img src="images/forassignment2.png" alt="Flowchart" title="Flowchart"></img>
	 
	     <p>In term 1 this unit looks at Organisations, Systems Analysis and Design, and IS in Organisations. Here we will start a group project that lasts all year. The first part of the project involves analysing a real world scenario and designing a system to deal with it. In term 2 we will cover databases and SQL (using ORACLE), and in the project we will implement the design we produced in term 1.</p><br>
	 
	     <p>We will learn a technique and then, in the next session, practice it. We'll then employ that technique in the next section of our team project during the next couple of weeks. All the way through we'll learn about various significant IS that are used in organisations, as well as some social issues surrounding the use of IS. We will also work on our report writing and presentation skills, upon which we will be assessed.  </p><br>
