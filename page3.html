		 <h2>Critical thinking and problem solving:</h2>
		 <p>Many of the times I have used my critical thinking and problem-solving techniques in real life to bring out some solution to a big problem. In some cases even if I don't know the solution to a problem directly, I still try to understand the problem properly and try to come out with a solution to that problem using my problem-solving skills, and that's what is actually called critical thinking. You know a problem, you focus on the problem, try to draw the solution in your mind and finally apply it in real time.</p><br>

		 <h2>Professionalism:</h2>
		 <p>As I mentioned before that this is the area where I have started to develop but still have room to improve. So before now, I had not much confidence in myself. But now where ever I see a problem that's related to my profession I try to be the first to think on it and try to come up with a solution.</p><br>
		 
		 <h2>Communication:</h2>
		 <p>I am starting to feel confident with my communication skills and I try to speak and share my views with as many people as I can. When a person works in an organization, communication allows you to get other's ideas and also share your ideas with the colleagues, which helps in solving a problem in a short time.</p><br>

		 <h2>Teamwork and Leadership:</h2>
		 <p>I have started to develop in this area, but I am not as Good in this. Having worked in groups in some of the university projects have let me know that how teamwork and leadership get your work that much easy, which is very difficult for a person to do individually. A leader in your group is an important individual who tells and divides the work and applies his skills to solve the problems.</p><br>
		 
		 <h2>Professional Development:</h2>
		 <p>No matter how much professional one is, there's everytime a new thing to learn from either your seniors or those who know more than you do in a specific field. As far I am concerned, the same thing applies to me. No one is perfect in anything, so during my work within a team, I keep on developing my skills and do whatever is good for my Professional development.</p><br>
		 
		 <h2>Learning and Research skills:</h2>
		 <p>No matter how much professional one is, there's everytime a new thing to learn from either your seniors or those who know more than you do in a specific field. As far I am concerned, the same thing applies to me. No one is perfect in anything, so during my work within a team, I keep on developing my skills and do whatever is good for my Professional development. Also doing research on something unknown to you allows you to learn and develop your thinking.</p><br>
		 
		 <h2>My course in Context:</h2>
		 <p>I try to keep myself up to date with the social and community contexts of my course. I know that for getting a good job I need to know what are the needs of the society and community. When I focus on that thing by developing my skills accordingly, there's a more chance that I get a good job in the future.</p><br>
		 
		 <h2>What do you think is good about your approach to university life so far?</h2>
		 <p>One thing I have noticed until now is that you are given enough time to focus on one task in the University. Because this is the time that we start to think about real life problems. Focus on the courses as a problem-solving tool in specified areas. In the University we are being trained to do our part in getting society to the next level of modernization and technology.</p><br>
		 
		 <h2>What would you like to change, or improve, about your approach to university life so far?</h2>
		 <p>So far I have liked University life very much, and I am quite surprised to see the relaxation or I can say enough time we are given to focus on one thing instead of being in hurry everywhere. So I haven't noticed anything negative so far which I can say needs improvement.</p><br>
